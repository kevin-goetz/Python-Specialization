# Python for Everybody - Getting Started with Python

## Description
This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. It covers the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python. The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook ‚ÄúPython for Everybody‚Äù.

## Skills
Technical skills learned in this specialization are:
- Why We Program
- Installing and Using Python
- Variables and Expressions
- Conditional Code
- Functions
- Loops and Iteration


## Assignments & Certificate
This courses spans over multiple weeks and it usually has at least one of the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises
- Quizzes (Multiple Choice)

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform. If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 5 course certificates within this specialization, you get the specialization certificate.

**Important Notes**:
- The .py-files of the coding exercises adhere to the syntax style of the Flake8 linter and therefore contain "# noqa" (No Quality Assurance) from time to time.
- The code may also contain "# %%" which is a magic cell function that let's you enter the interactive window (notebook style in .py-files) in VSCode

## Personal Learnings
After immersing myself in IDEs and Text Editors for programming with Python, I find Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (or just "Code") to be the best fit between writing programs and doing Data Science work (e.g. EDA). With the extensions "Python" and "Jupyter" installed, one can have the benefits of a fully fledged IDE and a Notebook.

If you prompt the user for input, always plan for the worst and dumbest input possible and apply some error handling so your program doesn't break. This also gives you the possibility to give some feedback to the user for correct input.
