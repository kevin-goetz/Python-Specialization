# Python for Everybody - Python Data Structures

## Description
This course introduces the core data structures of the Python programming language. It moves past the basics of procedural programming and explores how a programmer can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course covers Chapters 6-10 of the textbook ‚ÄúPython for Everybody‚Äù.

## Skills
Technical skills learned in this specialization are:
- Method vs. Function
- Floats, Integers and Booleans
- Strings
- Tuples
- Sets
- Lists
- Dictionaries


## Assignments & Certificate
This courses spans over multiple weeks and it usually has at least one of the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises
- Quizzes (Multiple Choice)

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform. If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 5 course certificates within this specialization, you get the specialization certificate.

**Important Notes**:
- The .py-files of the coding exercises adhere to the syntax style of the Flake8 linter and therefore contain "# noqa" (No Quality Assurance) from time to time.
- The code may also contain "# %%" which is a magic cell function that let's you enter the interactive window (notebook style in .py-files) in VSCode

## Personal Learnings
Every data structure has it's pros and cons, there is no "one-size-fits-all". Lists are often preferred because they are fexible and come with a lot of methods, but there are faster containers for querying like sets or dictionaries (key-value mappings), that apply the principles of hashing algorithms under the hood.

Once I understood the different nuances of the built-in data structures in python, I did better understand the principles of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and the meaning of an objects identity and what mutability is. The course doesn't go that deep, that's why I highly recommend signing a membership for the [medium platform](https://medium.com/) and subscribe to the publications ["Towards Data Science"](https://towardsdatascience.com/) and ["Python in plain English"](https://python.plainenglish.io/) to read and learn on your own :-)
