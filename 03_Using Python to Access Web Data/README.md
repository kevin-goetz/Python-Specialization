# Python for Everybody - Using Python to Access Web Data

## Description
This course shows how one can treat the Internet as a source of data. It teaches to scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs. The programmer will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python. This course will cover chapters 11-13 of the textbook ‚ÄúPython for Everybody‚Äù. To succeed in this course, you should be familiar with the material covered in chapters 1-10 of the textbook and the first two courses in this specialization. These topics include variables and expressions, conditional execution (loops, branching, and try/except), functions, Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples), and manipulating files. 

## Skills
Technical skills learned in this specialization are:
- APIs
- HTML
- XML
- JSON
- Web Scraping
- Regular Expressions


## Assignments & Certificate
This courses spans over multiple weeks and it usually has at least one of the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises
- Quizzes (Multiple Choice)

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform. If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 5 course certificates within this specialization, you get the specialization certificate.

**Important Notes**:
- The .py-files of the coding exercises adhere to the syntax style of the Flake8 linter and therefore contain "# noqa" (No Quality Assurance) from time to time.
- The code may also contain "# %%" which is a magic cell function that let's you enter the interactive window (notebook style in .py-files) in VSCode

## Personal Learnings
Webscraping isn't as complicated as I initially thought it was. The browser function "inspect" comes in handy to view the architecture of the website and learn about it's HTML. From there on it is quite straight forward. The hard part though is to clean the data from the web. Regular Expressions seemed to be gibberish when encountered first, but they are very powerful for string parsing and - when applied correctly - can clean even the messiest data.

JSON over XML. I found JSON to be much more intuitive and simple compared to XML because it's basically like nested dictionaries. I even store my passwords in a JSON ever since so I can retrieve those easily within a script or notebook without exposing them to other users.
