# Python for Everybody - Using Python to Access Web Data

## Description
This course introduces students to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort. The course uses SQLite3 as its database.  Participants also build web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and visualization processes. This course uses the D3.js library to do basic data visualization. The content is also covered in the Chapters 14-15 of the book ‚ÄúPython for Everybody‚Äù. To succeed in this course, you should be familiar with the material covered in Chapters 1-13 of the textbook and the first three courses in this specialization.

## Skills
Technical skills learned in this specialization are:
- Python Programming
- Web Scraping
- Database (DBMS)
- Sqlite3
- SQL


## Assignments & Certificate
This courses spans over multiple weeks and it usually has at least one of the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises
- Quizzes (Multiple Choice)

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform. If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 5 course certificates within this specialization, you get the specialization certificate.

**Important Notes**:
- The .py-files of the coding exercises adhere to the syntax style of the Flake8 linter and therefore contain "# noqa" (No Quality Assurance) from time to time.
- The code may also contain "# %%" which is a magic cell function that let's you enter the interactive window (notebook style in .py-files) in VSCode

## Personal Learnings
Coming from a Analyst role where I used SQL on a daily basis, it was quiet interesting to build up a database by myself. Usually (as a analyst) you already have the data in a normalized form (more or less, depends on the usecase and architecture) in your database and you have to join and aggregate the data for your analysis / report. This time it was the other way around: The data was in a txt-file or xml-file and you had to split it up and normalize it into different tables that can be joined by keys. It was an interesting change of perspective for me and I definitely learned some more about RELATIONAL database management.
