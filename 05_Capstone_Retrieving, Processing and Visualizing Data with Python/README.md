# Python for Everybody - Capstone: Retrieving, Processing and Visualizing Data with Python

## Description
The Capstone was an extensive quiz on all the things learned in the previous courses of the specialization.
There was also an Honors Track which required the completion of projects with the community of learners to earn
additional recognition on your certificate. I did only do the quiz in this course, so there are no scripts to upload here.

See my other repositories for more projects :-)

## Assignments & Certificate
This course was different than the previous ones in that it had one big quiz testing all the content of the specialization, but not having a mandatory coding exercise.
- Capstone Quiz (not included here)
- Capstone Project (not mandatory, only in Honor's Track; unfortunately didn't do it, so not included)

The quiz was also auto-graded by the platform. If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 5 course certificates within this specialization, you get the specialization certificate.

## Personal Learnings
Looking back and already having done some other projects I definitely should have chosen the honors track and do this project as an additional assignment. It's okay to do courses to start from somewhere, but in my experience it's best to do hands on Data Science as soon as possible. Applying what you learned is the real learning, especially with programming. You can watch sports all day and you most definitely learn something by it, but if you want to be good at sports you have to go out there (talking to you, comfort zone) and practice it. There is no way around it and I will remind myself of it in the future.
