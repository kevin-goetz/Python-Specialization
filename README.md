# Python for Everybody - Specialization

## Description
This 5-course Python specialization from the University of Michigan (hosted on Coursera) introduces fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. The courses build up on each other and with a pace of 3h/week it should take up to 8 month to complete this specialization.

## Courses
This specialization has 5 courses, each of them covering different topics and python packages. Every course has it's own README in this Repo, so if you are interested feel free to visit my other folders (click the links). The courses are:
1. Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
2. Python Data Structures
3. Using Python to Access Web Data
4. Using Databases with Python
5. Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python

## Technology Stack
Technical skills learned in this specialization are:
- Basic Programming Principles
- Python Programming (Syntax And Semantics)
- built-in Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, Integers, Strings, Floats, etc.)
- Regular Expressions
- File Handling
- Error Handling
- Database (DBMS)
- SQL & Sqlite
- Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Requests, urllib)

For a more detailed list please see visit the course folders of this Repo.

## Assignments & Certificate
Each of the 5 courses spans over multiple weeks. Every week usually has at least one of the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises
- Quizzes (Multiple Choice)
- Peer Reviews

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform, peer reviews are graded by your fellow student colleagues who are also attending the course.
If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 5 certificates, you get the specialization certificate.

## Personal Learnings
I highly recommend investing more time (~5h/week) so you can experiment with the exercises, try new things and and play around with the code, writing it from scratch and even try out some other challenges specific to the topics on Codewars. Codewars - to my knowledge and taste - is the best online coding challenge website available and it helped me a lot to think problem oriented and grasp different nuances of specific data structures, methods and coding styles.

Googling error messages took more time than I thought and persistence is key to coding. One thing that I have learned that is very helpful is that when you get stuck, just do something different off the screen for 5-10 minutes and try not to think about it. Then go back and have a relaxed look at your code - most of the time it's those basic things you usually don't do wrong and therefore didn't pay enough attention to :-)
